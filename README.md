##  Smart Contract Audit

### What is a Smart Contract Audit?

A smart contract audit is a timeboxed, security based code review of a smart contract system.

An auditor's goal is to find as many security vulnerabilities as possible and educate the protocol on best practices moving forward in development. Auditors leverage a variety of tools and expertise to find these vulnerabilities.

Why is a security audit so important?

Well, the statistics I mentioned in the introduction speak for themselves. With billions of dollars being stolen from unaudited code, the industry can't afford not to improve their security.

The immutability of the blockchain renders patching and updating frequently impossible, impractical or expensive. So having confidence in the security of your code is key.

An audit can actually accomplish much more than just checking for bugs. An audit can:

 **Improve your developer team's understanding of code**

 **Improve developer speed and efficiency**

 **Teach the latest tooling**

Often a single audit isn't even enough and protocols embark on a security journey including a number of steps like

**formal verification**

**competitive audits**

**Bug Bounty Programs**

**Private Audits**

**Mitigation Reviews**

...and more.

Securing your code is an on going journey and just as your protocol evolves over time, so will your security needs.

Additionally, working with multiple auditors and having multiple eyes on your code can uncover even more vulnerabilities than a single review. This is one of the biggest advantages of a competitive audit platform like CodeHawks.

If two heads are better than one, what are dozens or hundreds of heads capable of?

Keys To a Successful Audit
There are a few things you as a developer can do to prepare for an audit to ensure things are successful and smooth.

**Have clear Documentation**

**Robust test suite, ideally including fuzz tests**

**Code should be commented and readable**

**Modern best practices followed**

**Established communication channel between developer and auditors**

**Do an initial video walkthrough of the code**

I'll stress point 5 for a moment. The developers of a protocol are always going to have more context of a code base than an auditor will, having clear and efficient communication is important for allowing clear understanding of expected functionality and the ability to verify desired behaviour.

This clear understanding of what should happen is paramount. 80% of vulnerabilities found aren't broken code, but business logic.

### What an audit isn't

An audit is not a guarantee that your code is bug free.

Security is a continuous process that is always evolving with new vulnerabilities popping up each day. When/if an exploit hits your protocol, make sure you and your auditor have that line of communication to discuss the situation quickly.
